# Spring Security Lab

A clean, structured and evolving repository focused on practicing and understanding **Spring Security** fundamentals and advanced concepts.

This project starts as a minimal Spring Boot application and will progressively evolve as new security mechanisms are implemented and explored.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of this lab is to provide a practical environment to experiment with:

- Core Spring Security behavior
- Authentication & authorization flows
- Filters and the security chain
- Customization of the security context
- Stateless security approaches
- Real-world authentication patterns

All features will be added incrementally throughout the study process.
